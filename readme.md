#Readme Bash utilities

These are a collection of my current bash utilities, they are hosted on github because sharing is caring.

To run these files properly you will need to set up a loop to import the files and alias this should be done within your .bashrc

I have installed my utilities in a hidden folder named utilities, you can source them in any location you find convenient.

shopt -s expand_aliases for f in ~/.utilities/*.sh; do source $f; done

You will need to setup an importer in your .bash_profile

if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then source ~/.bashrc fi

That is all that is required.

##Optional

Optionally you can create a alias to the .utilities location for faster location.

alias utilities='~/.utilities && ls'
